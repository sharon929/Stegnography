Image-based Message Encryption using Python & OpenCV

Introduction

This project implements a simple yet effective method to hide secret messages inside images using Python and OpenCV. By leveraging steganography, messages can be embedded within image pixels, making them difficult to detect by unauthorized users.

Features

Hide secret messages within an image using pixel manipulation.

Secure encryption with a passcode authentication system.

Simple decryption process to retrieve the hidden message.

Uses OpenCV for image processing.

Technologies Used

Programming Language: Python

Libraries: OpenCV, OS

Concepts: Image Processing, ASCII Encoding, Cryptography Basics
